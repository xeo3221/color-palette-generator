# Color Palette Generator App

This is a simple color palette generator application built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The app allows users to generate custom color (using button or clicking space key on keyboard) palettes by selecting colors from a color picker. Users can lock individual colors they like and generate additional colors to complete their palette. Each color's hex code is displayed during hovering, and users can copy it to their clipboard with a single click. Additionally, users can lock colors in their palette and download the entire palette as a PNG image, making it easy to save and share their creations.
